# GoLang Learning Journey ðŸ“˜

Welcome to my Go language learning repository! ðŸŒŸ

This repository documents my progress in learning the Go programming language, following [Hitesh Choudhary's GoLang playlist on YouTube](https://youtu.be/_0R6H1m9o78?si=scVXrT5tGo81ErOt). Each lesson is organized into separate folders, covering various topics and concepts in Go, from basics to more advanced topics.

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to a lesson from the playlist and contains:

- `main.go`: The main Go file with the code learned in that lesson.
- `go.mod`: Go module file (where applicable).

### Folders

- `01hello`: Introduction to Go and "Hello, World!"
- `02variable`: Variables, constants, and data types in Go.
- `03userinput`: Handling user input.
- `04conversion`: Type conversion.
- `05mymaths`: Basic math functions and usage.
- `06mytime`: Working with time in Go.
- `07pointer`: Introduction to pointers in Go.
- `08array`: Arrays and their usage.
- `09slices`: Working with slices.
- `10Maps`: Introduction to maps in Go.
- `11Struct`: Working with structs in Go.
- `12ifElse`: Control flow with if-else statements.
- `13Switch`: Using switch statements.
- `14Loops`: Looping constructs in Go.
- `15Functions`: Defining and using functions.
- `16Methods`: Methods in Go, associated with structs.
- `17defer`: Using `defer` for function execution.
- `18File`: File handling in Go.
- `19webReq`: Making web requests in Go.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯

- Practice coding Go concepts by implementing them in examples.
- Develop a strong hold in Go programming (being Goffer), creating API, Web Servers using it.
- Document each lesson as I progress.

## Getting Started

To try out the code in each folder:

1. Install GO
2. Clone this repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git ./
   ```

3. Navigate to the folder you want to explore.
4. Run the Go code.
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

Happy coding Goofers ! ðŸš€
